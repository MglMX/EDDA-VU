## Task 3

## Plots: Fitted vs Residuals

plot(fitted(gala_glm), residuals(gala_glm)) 

# No specific pattern
# It's a scatter plot not visually good as it would suppose to be in linear regression model.


## Plots: Logarithmic-Fitted values vs Residuals

plot(log(fitted(gala_glm)), residuals(gala_glm))

# So we took logarithm to make the x-values fitted by a linear function in the plot. 
# This plot seems OK yet still no specific pattern
# And still it looks scatter too!

## Plots: Logarithmic-Fitted values vs Residuals with type = Response

plot(log(fitted(gala_glm)), residuals(gala_glm, type = "response"))

## The response residuals increase with log of the fitted values as expected from Poisson model

round(cooks.distance(gala_glm_sqrt), 2)
plot(cooks.distance(gala_glm_sqrt))

# Here we clearly have encountered an influence point: the Cookâ€™s distance is 27.93 that refers to "Isabela" as the potential point.
# If this Island is removed then we will not get any influential point from Cook's distance since except "Isabela" Since there is no data point with a Cook's distance that is close to or larger than 1 rather than Isablea = 27.93. 
# we can conclude that there will be no influence point if we remove it from the model.

## Task 5

par(mfrow=c(2,3))
for (i in 1:6) hist(gala_data[,i],main=colnames(gala_data)[i],xlab="",ylab="")
pairs(gala_data)
for (i in 1:6) hist(log(gala_data[,i]),main=colnames(gala_data)[i],xlab="",ylab="")
pairs(log(gala_data))

## If we look into the histograms then for the first one (without logarithm), we see that the histograms show the pattern of poisson distribution
## but when we applied logarithm in the second version we see that they are approximately equal to a normal distribution.

## If we look into the pairs then for the first one we see that, the data doesn't look significant to make any conclusion but when we applied the lograthim and cheked the pairs then we can see the data get more scattered and we can find some colinearity between Species~Area, Species~Elevation and Area~Elevation and there might be some colinearity between Nearest~Scruz but it's not obvious.
## In summary by applying the this we tried to normalize the distribution and we get more relevant information.

## Task 6

modlog=lm(log(Species)~log(Area)+log(Elevation)+log(Nearest)+log(Scruz+1)+log(Adjacent),data=gala_data)
summary(modlog)

modlog1=step(modlog)
summary(modlog1)

## if we look into the summary of modlog1 then we can see that log(Scruz + 1) has a p-value =  0.17 > 0.05. So maybe this variable is not significant but we are not sure whether AIC follows the exact same criteria in selecting a model.

######################## END  Task 6 #########################################

## Task 7

## When we apply the logarithm we normalized the data and we found colinearity between Spices and Area. And if we consider them without logarithm we do not really see any colinearity between them. By the definition of Species we get that we are counting the number of specifes in an island which follows Poissons regression model. Since Poisson uses logarithm to get the linear function so it makes more logical to apply logarithm to model log(Species) as a linear function of log(Area) than Species as a linear function of Area.

## Task 8

round(cooks.distance(modlog1), 2)
plot(cooks.distance(modlog1))
qqnorm(residuals(modlog1))
plot(residuals(modlog1), fitted(modlog1))

## Since there is no data point with a Cook's distance that is close to or larger than 1, we can conclude that there is no influence point.
## We can see that the QQ-plot showed normality 
## And the residulas plot looks scatter but doesn't follow any specific structure.
