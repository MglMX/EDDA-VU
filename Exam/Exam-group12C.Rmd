## Exercise 1



###Task 2

```{r}
galapagos=read.table("gala.txt", header=TRUE)

```


With this method, we start with all of the possible variables in our model. Then, we choose the one that gives the highest p-value. If this p-value is bigger than 0.05, we will discard the variable and repeat the process without it.

```{r}

galaglm=glm(sqrt(Species)~Area+Elevation+Nearest+Scruz+Adjacent,data=galapagos)
summary(galaglm)
```

The variable Nearest has the highest p-value with a p-value of 0.607. Since this p-value is bigger than 0.05, we discard it for our model and continue to the next iteration.

```{r}
galaglm=glm(sqrt(Species)~Area+Elevation+Scruz+Adjacent,data=galapagos) 
summary(galaglm)
```

The variable Scruz has the highest p-value with a p-value of 0.1837. Since this p-value is bigger than 0.05, we discard it for our model and continue to the next iteration.

```{r}
galaglm=glm(sqrt(Species)~Area+Elevation+Adjacent,data=galapagos) 
summary(galaglm)
```

The variable Area has the highest p-value with a p-value of 0.0639. Since the p-value is bigger than 0.05, we discard it for our model and continue to the next iteration.

```{r}
galaglm=glm(sqrt(Species)~Elevation+Adjacent,data=galapagos) 
summary(galaglm)
```

As we can see, all the p-values are smaller than 0.05, thus meaning that all the variables are significant for our model.


The resulting model of the step-down method is:
  
  sqrt(Species) = 3.5379 + 0.012942\*Elevation -0.00289\*Adjacent + error
