#15 is the people that didn't show improvement from the 18 
#and 3 is the people that showed improvement
#Same with the second column out of 14 8 showed improvement and 6 didn't
#So first column is students not receiving psi and second is the students receiving it
#row 1 shows the students that improved and row 2 the rest that didn't

#conclusion: #with pval 0.02 we can reject the null hypothesis, 
#which will be that the students receiving psi and the 
#ones not receiving it have the same probablity of improvement.

#T7

#I guess it's okay? Fishers test works with this kind of experiments

#T8

#Fishers is good for small counts in each 2x2 table cell. 
#More exact than the other approach, ut it doesn't work with  big counts.
