# For light1879 the value doesn't fall in the interval neither mean or median
# For light1882 the value doesn't fall in the interval neither mean or median
# For light it also doesn't fall in the interval neither mean or median
#It is not consistent

#Exercise 3
#3.1

klm
hist(klm)
qqnorm(klm)

#We check that the population doesn not seem normal this tell us that doing the t-test is not the best option
#We should perform the sign test Lecture 3 (13)
#Wilcoxon test doesn't seem appropiate because the population is not symetric

#Sign test
#We compute how many values are bigger than the median to test
n_bigger = sum(31>=klm)
n = length(klm)
binom.test(n_bigger,n,p=0.5)

median(klm) #Checking


#We can reject the null hypothesus that the median of the population is == 31. 
# How to change the null hypothesis to check if population is <= than 31?
# Checking confidence interval it gives 0.21 and 0.46. Can we say with that info the median is bigger than 31?

#3.2
quantile(klm,probs=0.9) #$Just checking

n_bigger = sum(72>klm);
binom.test(n_bigger,n,p=0.9)

#With a p value of 0.002 we can reject that at most 10% of the parts arrive later than 72 days. 
# If we check the confidence intervals 0.64 and 0.87, this means that between 13% and 36% of the pieces arrive later than 72 days (Can we say this?)
