###STEP-UP method


##Step1 - we choose the most significant variable - MODEL: expend

#V:BAD
crimelm=lm(expend~bad,data=expcrime) #R2: 0.6964
summary(crimelm)

#V:CRIME
crimelm=lm(expend~crime,data=expcrime) #R2: 0.1119
summary(crimelm)

#V:LAWYERS
crimelm=lm(expend~lawyers,data=expcrime) #R2: 0.9373
summary(crimelm)

#V:EMPLOY
#Highest R2 = Most significant (We choose this one)
crimelm=lm(expend~employ,data=expcrime) #R2: 0.954
summary(crimelm)

#V:POP
crimelm=lm(expend~pop,data=expcrime) #R2: 0.9073
summary(crimelm)


##Step2 - Same coming from R2=0.954 - MODEL: expend~employ

#V:BAD
crimelm=lm(expend~employ+bad,data=expcrime) #R2: 0.9551
summary(crimelm)

#V:CRIME
crimelm=lm(expend~employ+crime,data=expcrime) #R2: 0.9551
summary(crimelm)

#V:LAWYERS
#Highest R2 = Most significant (We choose this one)
crimelm=lm(expend~employ+lawyers,data=expcrime) #R2: 0.9632
summary(crimelm)

#V:POP
crimelm=lm(expend~employ+pop,data=expcrime) #R2: 0.9543
summary(crimelm)


##Step3 - Same coming from R2=0.9632 - MODEL:expend~employ+lawyers

#V:BAD
crimelm=lm(expend~employ+lawyers+bad,data=expcrime) #R2: 0.9639
summary(crimelm)

#V:POP
crimelm=lm(expend~employ+lawyers+pop,data=expcrime) #R2: 0.9637
summary(crimelm)

#V:CRIME
crimelm=lm(expend~employ+lawyers+crime,data=expcrime) #R2: 0.9632
summary(crimelm)

##Adding any of these variables = unsignificant explanatory variables only +0.001 change


###The resulting model of the step-up method is

crimelm=lm(expend~employ+lawyers,data=expcrime) #R2: 0.9632
summary(crimelm)
#total = -1.107e+02 + 12.971e-02*employ + 2.686e-02*lawyers + error


###STEP-DOWN method


#Step1: We choose the one with highest p-value. 
##If p-value>0.05 it's unsignificant and we get it out

crimelm=lm(expend~employ+bad+crime+lawyers+pop,data=expcrime) 
summary(crimelm)
#crime has the highest p-value=0.255534 -- p-val>0.05 -- out


#Step2: Same

crimelm=lm(expend~employ+bad+lawyers+pop,data=expcrime) 
summary(crimelm)

#pop has the highest p-value=0.06012 -- p-val>0.05 -- out


#Step3: Same

crimelm=lm(expend~employ+bad+lawyers,data=expcrime) 
summary(crimelm)

#bad has the highest p-value=0.34496 -- p-val>0.05 -- out


#Step4: Same

crimelm=lm(expend~employ+lawyers,data=expcrime) 
summary(crimelm)

#All p-values<0.05 = all variables are significant


###The resulting model of the step-up method is

crimelm=lm(expend~employ+lawyers,data=expcrime)
summary(crimelm)
#total = -1.107e+02 + 12.971e-02*employ + 2.686e-02*lawyers + error

#WE GET THE SAME MODEL USING BOTH METHODS


###DIAGNOSTICS

##scatter plot of Y against each X separately 
##(this yields overall picture, and shows outlying values.)

expcrime = read.table("expensescrime.txt", header=TRUE); pairs(expcrime)


##scatter plot of residuals against each Xk in the model separately 
##(look at pattern(curved?) and spread.)

attach(expcrime)
crimelm=lm(expend~employ)
plot(residuals(crimelm),employ)

crimelm=lm(expend~lawyers)
plot(residuals(crimelm),lawyers)


##scatter plot of residuals against each Xk not in the model separately 
##(look at pattern â€” linear? then include!)

plot(residuals(crimelm),pop)
plot(residuals(crimelm),bad)
plot(residuals(crimelm),crime)


##scatter plot of residuals against Y 
##(look at spread.)

plot(residuals(crimelm),expend)
plot(residuals(crimelm),fitted(crimelm))


##normal QQ-plot of the residuals 
##(check normality assumption.)

qqnorm(residuals(crimelm))
shapiro.test(residuals(crimelm))



###influence points(outliers)
round(cooks.distance(crimelm), 2)
plot(cooks.distance(crimelm))


###collinearity

##Graphical way to investigate collinearity:
# scatter plot of Xj against Xk for all combinations j, k 
#(check pairwise collinearity)

pairs(expcrime)

##Numerical way to investigate collinearity:
#pairwise linear correlation of Xj and Xk for all combinations j, k 
#(check whether these are far from 0)

round(cor(expcrime[,5:6]),2)
# they are collinear with 0.97
# we can't have both collinear variables in our model so we get lawyers out
